README - REMOv4-0

REMOv4-0 (Rolling Episodic Memory Organizer Version 4-0) is an upgraded version of the memory management system designed to integrate with a cognitive agent. This version introduces improvements in error handling, organization, efficiency, and overall code structure. It is designed to work with the CognitiveAgentV4-0, an agent with emotion-awareness and enhanced memory processing capabilities.
Features

    Hierarchical memory organization
    Efficient and organized code structure
    Integration with the CognitiveAgentV4-0
    Error handling improvements
    Local folder-based storage system

Setup and Installation

    Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
    Install the required packages:

    arduino

    pip install fastapi
    pip install uvicorn
    pip install numpy
    pip install sklearn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install tensorflow_hub
    pip install tensorflow-text
    pip install PyYAML

    Download and place the REMOv4-0 code in your project directory.
    Download and place the CognitiveAgentV4-0 code in your project directory.
    Create a main.py file, import the CognitiveAgentV4, and define the FastAPI routes.

Usage

Use the CognitiveAgentV4-0 as part of your cognitive agent application, integrating it with the main FastAPI application. Utilize the remember() and recall() methods for managing short-term and long-term memory.

python

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from cognitive_agent_v4 import CognitiveAgentV4
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize CognitiveAgentV4
cognitive_agent = CognitiveAgentV4()

@app.post("/interact_v4")
async def interact_v4(input_text: str):
    response = cognitive_agent.process_input(input_text)
    return {"response": response}

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

css

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

After starting the server, interact with the CognitiveAgentV4-0 by making POST requests to the /interact_v4 endpoint with an input text, and the agent will return an appropriate response.
Future Work

    Upgrading the system for distributed storage and retrieval for increased scalability
    Integrating additional cognitive features and optimizations
