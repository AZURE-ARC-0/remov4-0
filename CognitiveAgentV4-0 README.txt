CognitiveAgentV4-0 README

This README outlines the key components and usage instructions for CognitiveAgentV4-0, an upgraded version of the cognitive agent that integrates with REMOv4-0 for improved memory management.
Features

    Integration with REMOv4-0 for enhanced memory management.
    Enhanced reactivity, reflection, and planning capabilities.
    Improved emotion modeling and retrieval mechanisms.
    Scalable memory system, designed to work efficiently with local storage or distributed systems (future upgrade).

Prerequisites

    Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
    Required packages installed:

    arduino

    pip install fastapi
    pip install uvicorn
    pip install numpy
    pip install sklearn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install tensorflow_hub
    pip install tensorflow-text
    pip install PyYAML

Code Structure

The CognitiveAgentV4-0 codebase includes the following primary components:

    cognitive_agent_v4.py: The main module containing the CognitiveAgentV4-0 class, which provides methods for processing input, and integrates with REMOv4-0 for memory management.
    remo_v4.py: The REMOv4-0 class, responsible for storing and retrieving memory efficiently.

Implementation Steps
Step 1: Download REMOv4-0 and CognitiveAgentV4-0 code

Download and place the REMOv4-0 code (remo_v4.py) and CognitiveAgentV4-0 code (cognitive_agent_v4.py) in your project directory.
Step 2: Create the main application file

Create a main.py file in your project directory, which will serve as the entry point for your FastAPI application.

python

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from cognitive_agent_v4 import CognitiveAgentV4
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize CognitiveAgentV4
cognitive_agent = CognitiveAgentV4()

@app.post("/interact_v4")
async def interact_v4(input_text: str):
    response = cognitive_agent.process_input(input_text)
    return {"response": response}

Step 3: Run the FastAPI application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

css

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

This will start the server on the default address (http://0.0.0.0:8000).
Step 4: Interact with CognitiveAgentV4-0

After starting the server, interact with the CognitiveAgentV4-0 by making POST requests to the /interact_v4 endpoint with an input text, and the agent will return an appropriate response.

You can use an HTTP client like Postman or CURL to send requests, or you can create a simple user interface for more interactive testing.

By following this README and the accompanying implementation documentation, you should be able to successfully integrate CognitiveAgentV4-0 with REMOv4-0 and start building your own cognitive agent applications.
