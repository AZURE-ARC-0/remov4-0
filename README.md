Remov4-0
Remov4-0 is a project that aims to create a new memory system based on generative agents paper/ remo / remo lang flow with paired agent. It uses a combination of natural language processing, deep learning, and symbolic reasoning to understand natural language commands and queries, and to produce executable code in various programming languages.

Installation
To install Remov4-0, you will need the following requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.9 or higher
Transformers 4.11 or higher
NLTK 3.6 or higher
SymPy 1.9 or higher
You can install the requirements using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use Remov4-0, you can run the remov4-0.py script with the following arguments:

–language: The programming language to generate code in. Currently supported languages are Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript. Default is Python.
–command: The natural language command or query to execute. For example, “create a function that returns the sum of two numbers”.
–output: The name of the file to save the generated code. Default is output.py.
For example, to generate a Python function that returns the sum of two numbers, you can run:

python remov4-0.py --language python --command "create a function that returns the sum of two numbers" --output sum.py
This will create a file called sum.py with the following content:

def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
Examples
Here are some more examples of using Remov4-0 with different languages and commands:

Language	Command	Output
Java	“create a class called Person with two fields name and age and a constructor that assigns them”	```java
public class Person {		
private String name;
private int age;

public Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
}

| C# | "create a method that reverses a string" | ```csharp
public string Reverse(string s) {
    char[] chars = s.ToCharArray();
    Array.Reverse(chars);
    return new string(chars);
}
``` |
| JavaScript | "create a function that checks if a number is even or odd" | ```javascript
function isEvenOrOdd(n) {
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        return "even";
    } else {
        return "odd";
    }
}
``` |
