Overview

CognitiveAgentV4-0 is an advanced cognitive agent that integrates with the REMOv4-0 memory system. This document aims to help you understand the code structure and guide you through the implementation process. You'll learn how to set up the environment, run the code, and interact with the CognitiveAgentV4-0.
Code Structure

The CognitiveAgentV4-0 codebase includes the following primary components:

    cognitive_agent_v4.py: The main module containing the CognitiveAgentV4-0 class, which provides methods for processing input, and integrates with REMOv4-0 for memory management.
    remo_v4.py: The REMOv4-0 class, responsible for storing and retrieving memory efficiently.

Setting up the Environment

    Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

    Install the required packages using pip:

    arduino

    pip install fastapi
    pip install uvicorn
    pip install numpy
    pip install sklearn
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install tensorflow_hub
    pip install tensorflow-text
    pip install PyYAML

    Download and place the REMOv4-0 code (remo_v4.py) and CognitiveAgentV4-0 code (cognitive_agent_v4.py) in your project directory.

Using CognitiveAgentV4-0
Step 1: Create the main application file

Create a main.py file in your project directory, which will serve as the entry point for your FastAPI application.

python

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from cognitive_agent_v4 import CognitiveAgentV4
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize CognitiveAgentV4
cognitive_agent = CognitiveAgentV4()

@app.post("/interact_v4")
async def interact_v4(input_text: str):
    response = cognitive_agent.process_input(input_text)
    return {"response": response}

Step 2: Run the FastAPI application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

css

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

This will start the server on the default address (http://0.0.0.0:8000).
Step 3: Interact with CognitiveAgentV4-0

After starting the server, interact with the CognitiveAgentV4-0 by making POST requests to the /interact_v4 endpoint with an input text, and the agent will return an appropriate response.

You can use an HTTP client like Postman or CURL to send requests, or you can create a simple user interface for more interactive testing.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the implementation process, consider the following common solutions:

    Ensure you have installed all the required packages listed in the prerequisites.
    Make sure your Python version is 3.7 or later.
    Check the network connectivity and ensure that the FastAPI server is running.
